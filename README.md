## What's this?

This is our repository where we keep track of our conversations and your employment at GitHub. New issues open automatically; a weekly 1:1 issue and one for the professional development check-in every three months.

If you'd rather prefer a slightly different cycle that's cool; we'll just tweak the corresponding Action then. If you have suggestions for improvement, you're most welcome to contribute, too!
